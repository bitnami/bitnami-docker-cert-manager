# What is Cert-manager?

Cert-manager is a part of the cert-manager project.
cert-manager is a Kubernetes add-on to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates from various issuing sources.

It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date periodically, and attempt to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.

# Pre-requisites

Kubernetes cluster with `CustomResourceDefinition` or `ThirdPartyResource support`

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DTC)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/work-with-non-root-containers/).

# How to deploy Cert-manager in Kubernetes?

You can find an example for testing in the file `test.yaml`. To launch this sample file run:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f test.yaml
```

> NOTE: If you are pulling from a private containers registry, replace the image name with the full URL to the docker image. E.g.
>
> - image: 'your-registry/image-name:your-version'

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

> NOTE: Debian 8 images have been deprecated in favor of Debian 9 images. Bitnami will not longer publish new Docker images based on Debian 8.

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).


* [`0-debian-9`, `0.12.0-debian-9-r12`, `0`, `0.12.0`, `0.12.0-r12`, `latest` (0/debian-9/Dockerfile)](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-cert-manager/blob/0.12.0-debian-9-r12/0/debian-9/Dockerfile)
